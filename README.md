# SPL2
Project Title : Programming Platform

A Programming platform is a platform where a user can see some programming problems and solve them by writing code, and submit that code in that system for judgement. In this project, only authenticated user can enter to the system.
Only administrator can set, remove or modify contest and problems. Normal user(problem solver) can participate in contest and solve those problems. The programming language of the submitted code must be in c, c++ or java. Then the system will compile and execute the submitted code and give a verdict to the user. Here the verdict will be one of these (compilation error, right answer, wrong answer, time limit exceed).  An user can also modify his profile information.
